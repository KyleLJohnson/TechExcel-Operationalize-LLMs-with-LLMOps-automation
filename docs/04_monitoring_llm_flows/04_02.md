##### 1) Add Content Safety to your Solution

Create a basic **flow** from scratch (a simple Joke flow will be constructed).  
   
Make the following adjustments to the flow as per the instructions below:  
   
1. Insert a [Content Safety tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/prompt-flow/tools-reference/content-safety-text-tool) node between the input and the language model (LLM).  
   
2. Add a Python node to process the output from the Content Safety tool and determine whether to proceed with the standard flow or not. For guidance on creating a conditional flow in Prompt Flow, refer to [this example](https://github.com/microsoft/promptflow/tree/main/examples/flows/standard/conditional-flow-for-if-else).  
   
3. Add a Python node to craft a default response.  
   
4. Implement conditions to trigger one response or another, depending on the Content Safety's result.  
   
5. Develop a final node to compile and deliver the response to the user.
