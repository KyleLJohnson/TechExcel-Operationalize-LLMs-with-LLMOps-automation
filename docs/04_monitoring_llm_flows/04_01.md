##### 1) Monitoring your LLMs flow

Modify the output node of the workflow to incorporate the required information for computing the metrics that need monitoring, as outlined in the [User Experience](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/monitor-quality-safety#user-experience) section of the Monitor Quality and Safety of Deployed Applications documentation. Be sure to activate monitoring by selecting the "Enable" button within the Model Monitoring section when deploying the workflow. Then test the flows and see how the monitoring reacts and what information you can gather from that monitoring.
