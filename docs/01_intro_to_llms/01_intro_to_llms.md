# Exercise 01 - Introduction to LLMs and Azure AI Services

##  Scenario

In this exercise, we will provide an overview of how to use Azure AI to work with large language models (LLMs) tailored for Lamna Healthcare Company. Given Lamnaâ€™s recent shift from AWS and the failed Sagemaker implementation, this exercise aims to familiarize the team with the basics of Azure AI services and how they can be leveraged to meet their unique needs.

The focus will be on understanding the overall process of creating, evaluating, and deploying LLMs within the Azure environment. This foundational knowledge will be crucial as we delve deeper into the build, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring processes in subsequent lessons.

By the end of this exercise, you as part of the Lamna team will have a solid understanding of the basic tools and services available in Azure AI Studio.

## Objectives

After you complete this exercise, you will be able to:

* Use AzureAI Studio Playground.
* Work with an Open Source LLM Model.
* Test the prompt in Content Safety.
* Create a Prompt Flow flow.

## Lab Duration

* **Estimated Time:** 60 minutes
