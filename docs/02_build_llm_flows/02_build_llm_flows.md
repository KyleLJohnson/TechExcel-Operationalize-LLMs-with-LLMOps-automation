# Exercise 02 - Building LLMs Orchestration Flows

## Scenario

If you are running this exercise after Lesson 1, you don’t need to worry about this step. Otherwise, follow the setup instructions from Lesson 1 to create a project and its associated resources in Azure AI Studio, as well as to deploy the GPT-4 model.

In this exercise, the focus will be on creating and associating a conversational Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) flow with your already created model(s). This is particularly important for Lamna Healthcare Company, as it aims to enhance the performance and relevance of their 24/7 support virtual agent.

By the end of this exercise, Lamna’s team will have a functional RAG flow integrated with their GPT-4 model, setting a strong foundation for further enhancements and refinements in subsequent lessons.

## Objectives

After you complete this exercise, you will be able to:

* Create a conversational RAG flow.
* Create and populate a vector index.
* Test and validate using Prompt Flow.

## Lab Duration

* **Estimated Time:** 75 minutes
